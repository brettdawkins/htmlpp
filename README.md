# HTML++

HTML++ is a new declarative standard for building web interfaces without JavaScript frameworks.

**No hydration. No bundlers. No client-side routing hacks.**  
Just native behavior, composable components, and progressive enhancement â€” directly in HTML.

---

## ðŸš© Mission

Bring back simplicity.  
Build apps that feel like the web â€” fast, predictable, and free from frontend bloat.

---

## ðŸ§© Core Concepts

- **Native Components**: Use built-in tags like `<x-pagination>`, `<x-modal>`, `<x-swap>` â€” no JS required.
- **Declarative Interactions**: Define data-fetching, DOM updates, and state sync in markup.
- **Server-first**: Embrace SSR, caching, and CDN delivery without losing interactivity.
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JS, enhances when available.

## ðŸ“¦ Goals

- Define the HTML++ component spec
- Build a polyfill/runtime for existing browsers
- Create a forked browser or runtime shell with native support
- Replace 80% of JavaScript apps with clean HTML
